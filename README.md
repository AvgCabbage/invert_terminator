Relaunch terminator with alternate config

Something I wrote to swap between two terminator configs, one with white on black, the other black on white.  I found the two better for visibility reasons in different light on a dim laptop display, and depending on the colors behind the window (I like a little transparency in my term background).

Just compares and swaps out config file, simple solution to the problem.  Plan is to completely rewrite this to just modify the foreground/background color values in the config, rather than have the extra config files.  V2 is partially working, just haven't gotten around to cleaning it up and finishing.
